	  <h1>You arrive at the workshop</h1>
	  <p>A few weeks ago you signed up for your first ever coding course with Ladies Learning Code. This morning, you were so excited to get there that you arrive to the workshop ahead of schedule!</p>
	  <p>When you get there, you try buzzing in - but all you hear on the other end is a busy signal. That's no good. How are you supposed to get in?</p>
	  <p>Just then, you notice that the front door is slightly ajar. You push forward - there's no way you're missing out!</p>
