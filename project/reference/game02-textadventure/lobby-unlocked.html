      <h1>The Lobby</h1>
      <p>There are 3 mystery doors waiting for you in the lobby.</p>
      <p>The <strong>first door</strong> looks average, friendly and approachable.</p>
      <p>The <strong>second door</strong> in the middle of the room is brushed steel and larger than the other two. It is slightly ajar and looks heavy. Whatever is inside must be important...</p>
      <p>The <strong>third door</strong> is closed and has a frosted window and a sign that says "boardroom".</p>
