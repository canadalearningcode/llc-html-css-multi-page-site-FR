      <h1>What's behind Door Number 2?</h1>
      <p>You decide to approach the heavy metal door. With some effort you manage to push it open just enough so you can slip inside.</p>
      <p>Once you get past the door, you find yourself in a dark room with tall shelves on either side of you. On the shelves are laptops and other electronic devices - some with flashing LED lights. Boxes and bins are stacked on the ground before you, and there are a few electrical cables crossing back and forth. You realize quickly that you must tread lightly.</p>
      <p>"This must be the computer server room or something," you thought.</p>
      <p>In the middle of the room is a long, narrow corridor leading to a storage closet with a bright white light emitting from it.</p>
