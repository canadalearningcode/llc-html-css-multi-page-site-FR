      <h1>What's behind Door Number 3?</h1>
      <p>Perhaps the most obvious of the three doors - you decide to try your luck in the boardroom. Maybe there's someone in there that can help you find the LLC workshop.</p>
      <p>Upon entering the room you see a large boardroom table surrounded by a dozen leather-backed chairs. There isn't a person to be seen. Everything looks neat and tidy aside from one chair turned away from you at the end of the table. </p>
      <p>Draped over that chair is a ragged sweater and a scarf - perhaps someone forgot their belongings after a meeting? Then, after you take a few steps you get a whiff of a funky smell coming from the chair...</p>
